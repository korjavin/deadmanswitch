# Recipients in Dead Man's Switch

Recipients are trusted contacts who will receive your secrets when your Dead Man's Switch is triggered. This document explains how to manage recipients and test contact with them.

## Adding Recipients

1. Navigate to the Recipients page from the main menu
2. Click "Add New Recipient"
3. Fill in the required information:
   - Name: The recipient's full name
   - Email: A valid email address where they can be reached
   - Phone Number (optional): For future SMS notifications
   - Notes: Any additional information about this recipient

## Managing Secrets for Recipients

Each recipient can be assigned specific secrets that they will receive when your Dead Man's Switch is triggered.

1. From the Recipients page, click "Manage Secrets" for the recipient
2. Select the secrets you want to share with this recipient
3. Click "Save Assignments"

## Testing Contact with Recipients

It's important to verify that your recipients can be reached in case your Dead Man's Switch is triggered. The system provides a way to test contact with your recipients:

1. From the Recipients page, click "Test Contact" for the recipient
2. The system will send a test email to the recipient with:
   - Information about why they're receiving the email
   - A confirmation link they can click to verify receipt
   - An explanation that this is just a test

### Confirmation Process

When a recipient receives a test contact email:

1. They can click the confirmation link in the email
2. This will mark them as "Confirmed" in your Dead Man's Switch account
3. You will receive a notification when they confirm
4. The confirmation link is valid for 7 days

### Confirmation Status

Recipients can have one of three statuses:

- **Not Verified**: No test contact has been sent yet
- **Pending Confirmation**: A test contact has been sent, but the recipient hasn't confirmed yet
- **Confirmed**: The recipient has clicked the confirmation link

## Important Notes

- You don't need to test contact with all recipients, but it's recommended to test with at least your most important contacts
- If a recipient doesn't confirm within 7 days, you can send another test contact
- Even if a recipient is not confirmed, they will still receive your secrets when your Dead Man's Switch is triggered
- Testing contact helps ensure that your recipients' email addresses are correct and that they understand the purpose of the Dead Man's Switch
